<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy On Cardiovascular Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for cardiovascular disease involves modifying genes to treat or prevent heart conditions. The market is primarily divided into two types: viral gene therapy and non-viral gene therapy. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes directly into target cells, leveraging their natural ability to infect cells. In contrast, non-viral gene therapy employs methods like liposomes or nanoparticles to transport genetic material without using viruses, offering advantages in safety and manufacturing flexibility. Both approaches aim to improve patient outcomes in cardiovascular health.</p></p>
