<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cryogenic Distillation</li><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid nitrogen market primarily features two production methods: cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Cryogenic distillation involves cooling air to extremely low temperatures to separate nitrogen from other gases based on their boiling points. In contrast, pressure swing adsorption utilizes adsorbent materials under varying pressure to selectively capture nitrogen from air, releasing other gases. Both methods cater to different industrial requirements, ensuring a consistent supply of liquid nitrogen for applications like food preservation, medical processes, and industrial cooling.</p></p>
